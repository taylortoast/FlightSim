Hi. This is a continuation of my iPad-based Naval flight training simulation project. Please read and follow the attached markdown file ND_Project_Status_and_Next_Steps.md before doing anything else. We are resuming work on the Navigation Display (ND) subsystem. After reviewing the document, propose a concise “Today’s Plan” (3–6 steps) that respects all project invariants (1u=1m, ND range contract, camera math, unit systems) and stays within scope. Do not begin work until the plan is confirmed.
