# Unity Hierarchy JSON Viewer (Browser-Only)

A lightweight, **offline**, **vanilla-JavaScript** web app for inspecting Unity hierarchy exports generated by the *Hierarchy Exporter* editor tool.  
Nothing is uploaded. Everything runs locally in your browser.

This viewer is designed for **developers and technical reviewers** who need to understand:

- Scene and prefab structure  
- Parent/child relationships between GameObjects  
- Which components are attached to objects  
- How objects and components reference **other objects or assets**

---

## Files

```
index_relations.html
styles_relations.css
script_relations.js
```

Open `index_relations.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

No server, no build step, no dependencies.

---

## Supported Input

- A `.json` file produced by the **Unity Hierarchy Exporter**
- Works with:
  - `loadedScenes[]` or legacy `scenes[]`
  - `prefabs[]`
  - `rootObjects`, `components`, `fields`, and `refInfo`

---

## Basic Workflow

1. Open `index_relations.html`
2. Upload a JSON file using the file input in the top bar
3. The UI is built dynamically based on what exists in the JSON

---

## Layout Overview

The app uses a **three-pane layout**:

### 1. Sources (Left Pane)

Shows all **top-level data sources** found in the JSON:

- **Scenes**
  - Displayed as `Scene: <SceneName>`
  - Shows scene path if available
- **Prefabs**
  - Displayed as `Prefab: <PrefabName>`
  - Shows asset path or GUID

Clicking a source loads its hierarchy into the middle pane.

---

### 2. Hierarchy Tree (Middle Pane)

Displays the **GameObject hierarchy** for the selected scene or prefab.

- Parent/child relationships are shown using expandable nodes
- Each object shows:
  - Object name
  - Tag (if present)
  - Component count

Click an object name to inspect it.

---

### 3. Selection Details (Right Pane)

Shows detailed information for the selected GameObject.

#### Object Summary
- Full object path
- Scene or prefab context
- Instance ID
- Tag and layer
- Prefab asset GUID (if applicable)
- Transform values (position, rotation, scale)
- Child and component counts

---

## Components Section

Lists **all components attached to the object**.

Each component entry:
- Uses the short type name (e.g. `Transform`, `Animator`)
- Indicates:
  - Enabled/disabled state (when applicable)
  - Whether serialized properties were truncated

Expanding a component shows:
- Component type
- Instance ID
- Serialized properties (property path → value)
- Object references are resolved when possible

---

## References Section (Relationships)

This section visualizes **relationships between objects and assets**.

The table shows:
- **From**: the component containing the reference
- **Field**: serialized property path
- **To**: the referenced object or asset

### Navigation Behavior

- References to other GameObjects in the same JSON become clickable
- Clicking navigates directly to the referenced object
- Asset references show asset paths and GUIDs

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Debugging complex Unity scenes without opening Unity
- Reviewing prefab structure and wiring
- Sharing hierarchy context with teammates
- Feeding structured context into AI tools
- Verifying exporter output integrity

---

## Privacy & Safety

- Runs entirely in the browser
- No network requests
- No analytics
- JSON never leaves your machine

---

## Known Limitations

- Very large JSON files may impact performance
- Component field lists are capped for readability
- Tree selection highlighting is best-effort

---

## Tips

- Start with a Prefab source for a focused view
- Use the References section to understand dependencies
- Truncated components still provide enough metadata for diagnosis

---

This viewer is intentionally simple, inspectable, and easy to extend.
